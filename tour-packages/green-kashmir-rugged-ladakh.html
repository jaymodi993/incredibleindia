It is a tastefully laid garden in terraces, which commands a magnificent view of the Dal Lake below and surrounding mountain ranges.

<h4 class="day-block"><span>Day 03:</span> Srinagar - Gulmarg (60 Km / 2 hrs approx.)</h4>
<p><strong>Shikara boatride</strong> on Dal lake is one of the most soothing &amp; relaxing aspects of a holiday in Kashmir.</p>
<p>Early morning before breakfast we explore the Dal Lake and its Waterways and visit the floating vegetable market in a traditional Shikara boat. This unique kind of market can be only witnessed in Thailand and Kashmir. En route we shall see many species of aquatic birds on the lake, nestling on surrounding trees on floating marshes used for growing vegetables by local people, who have inherited a unique lifestyle living on the Lake for over decades. Return to Houseboat / Hotel for breakfast.</p>
<p>After breakfast we drive to Gulmarg (Meadows of Flower), 2730 m above sea level. On arrival we check-in the Hotel.</p>
<p>Gulmarg is a huge cup-shaped meadow, lush &amp; green, with slopes where the silence is broken only by the tinkle of cow-bells. Gulmarg has been the venue of many Indian films because of its breathtaking natural beauty. All around are snow-capped mountains, and on a clear day you can see all the way to Nanga Parbat mountain (8126 m) on one side &amp; Srinagar on another.</p>
<p>From Gulmarg a 6 km pony track leads upwards to Khilanmarg, Kongdoori &amp; Seven springs. Beyond Khilanmarg, 13 km from Gulmarg at the foot of the twin 4511 m Apharwat peaks is Alpather Lake (3843 m), which is frozen until mid-June and even later. For horse riding aficionados, Alpather Lake makes an exciting day's excursion, starting early morning and returning late evening. Gulmarg also has one of the world's highest green golf courses with 18 holes, as well as a clubhouse, which is a historical building in its own right. For a fun-filled ride of a most unusual kind, Gulmarg's newly constructed "gondola" cable-car (2.5 km) takes people through pine-clad slopes, to Kongdoori, which is at 3930 m. During winters Gulmarg becomes India's premier skiing resort and during this time this 2.5-km ropeway is used by skiers and other tourists to reach higher slopes.<br>

Now it is Kashmir's premier resort, cool even during the height of summer. Around Pahalgam are many places of interest because it set between fairly steep hills. The most beautiful of these is the huge, undulating meadow of Baisaran, surrounded by thickly wooded forests of pine. Hajan on the way to Chandanwari is an idyllic spot for a picnic.
