<h4 class="day-block"><span>Day 01:</span> Arrive in Delhi</h4>
<p class="contentHeading1">Arrive by International flight, after traditional <strong>'Swagat'</strong> (Welcome) our representative would assist you at airport &amp; escort your to hotel for check in.</p>
<p><strong>Delhi</strong> is a bustling metropolis, which successfully combines in its folds the ancient with modern. Its strategic location was the prime reasons why successive dynasties chose it as their seat of power. In fact, more mythological cities are believed to be here, like the city of <strong>Indraprastha</strong> from the Hindu epic Mahabharata, founded around 5000 BC. Numerous monuments were built over several centuries by different rulers like Qutub-ud-din Aibek, Alauddin Khilji, Tughlaks, Humayun &amp; Shah Jahan, who built the Walled City <strong>Shah Jahanabad.</strong></p>
<p>Later in first half of 20th century much of New Delhi was planned by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who laid out a grandiose central administrative area as a testament to British rule in India. The division in walled city &amp; New Delhi also marks the division in life styles.<br>

<p>Today, we drive to <strong>Mandawa</strong> in the heart of the semi-arid Shekhawati region. Shekhawati owes its name to Rao Shekha who ruled this area in the 14th century. The Fort of Mandawa was built in the year 1755 by Thakur Nawal Singh, the founder of the town. These were the times when Mandawa was settled &amp; fortified by the rich &amp; dominant Silk Route merchants of the region, who constructed many Havelis (Mansions), Chhatris (Cenotaphs), Temples &amp; Baolis (Step-wells) with ornate frescoes adorning their walls &amp; now aptly given the epithet - <strong>Open-Air Gallery.</strong> With the migration of these merchant families, their old settlements remained in total obscurity with no one to look after them. Mandawa still retains the charm &amp; aura of a bygone era &amp; coming here is like stepping into a different world.<br>
